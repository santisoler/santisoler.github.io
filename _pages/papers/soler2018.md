## Abstract

We present a new methodology to compute the gravitational fields generated by
tesseroids (spherical prisms) whose density varies continuously with depth
according to an arbitrary function. It approximates the gravitational fields
through the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature along with two discretization algorithms
that automatically control its accuracy by adaptively dividing the tesseroid
into smaller ones. The first one is a preexisting adaptive discretization
algorithm that reduces the errors due to the distance between the tesseroid and
the computation point. The second is a new density-based discretization
algorithm that decreases the errors introduced by the variation of the density
function with depth. The amount of divisions made by each algorithm is
indirectly controlled by two parameters: the distance-size ratio and the delta
ratio. We have obtained analytical solutions for a spherical shell with radially
variable density and compared them to the results of the numerical model for
linear and exponential density functions. These comparisons allowed us to obtain
optimum values for the distance-size and delta ratios that yield an accuracy of
0.1% of the analytical solutions. The resulting optimal values of distance-size
ratio for the gravitational potential, its gradient, and Marussi tensor are 1,
2 and 8, respectively. A delta ratio of 0.2 is needed for the computation of the
gravitational potential and its gradient components, while a value of 0.01 must
be used for the Marussi tensor components. Lastly, we apply this new methodology
to model the Neuquén Basin, a foreland basin in Argentina with a maximum depth
of over 5000 m, using an exponential density function.
