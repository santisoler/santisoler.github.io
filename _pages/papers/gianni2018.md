## Abstract

Plate kinematic reconstructions show that the Farallon-Phoenix (Aluk)
spreading center subducted under South America sometime between the Late
Cretaceous and the Paleogene periods. Geological studies have supported a
ridge-trench interaction in Patagonia during Paleocene to Eocene times mostly
based on the documentation of slab window magmatism and Andean arc-quiescence.
However, a revision of most recent works dealing with the Paleogene tectonic
evolution of Central Patagonia between 39 °S to 50 °S highlights
inconsistencies in this model. Particularly, the existence of two discrete
areas with simultaneous slab window-related magmatism separated by a sector
with plate-wide contraction, along with a spatio-temporal mismatch between
magmatism location and ridge kinematics, preclude a single ridge-trench
interaction. With the purpose to better understand this complex tectonic
setting, we integrated this updated geological evolution into a plate
kinematic model. We propose that the oblique collision of a segmented
Farallon-Phoenix/Aluk mid-ocean ridge would explain the latitudinally vari-
able tectonomagmatic evolution of Patagonia during early Paleogene times.
Finally, this work adds resolution to geodynamic processes in active margins
where complex midocean ridge-trench interactions take place.
