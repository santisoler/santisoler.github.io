I'm a Lic. in Physics, got my degree at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario,
Argentina. Now I'm a PhD Student in Geophysics at the [Universidad Nacional
de San Juan][unsj], doing my research at the
[Instituto Geofísico Sismológico Volponi][igsv], with the support of
a scholarship provided by [CONICET].

I'm currently teaching Statistical Mechanics and Physics I for Astronomy and
Geophysics at the [Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales][fcefn],
[UNSJ][unsj].

Longtime GNU/Linux user and a Software Libre supporter: I've been using [Debian]
(and Debian-based distros) for a while, but now I'm a [Manjaro] user.
If you haven't ever heard of Software Libre or don't precisely know what
it is, I encourage you to read the
[Wikipedia entry about Free Software][wiki-free-soft] and
further the [Free Software Foundation documentation][fsf-docs].

I'm a [Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org) contributor, a
Python library for geophysical modeling and inversion, released under a
Software Libre license. I encourage every scientist to leave proprietary
software behind and start using Free Software on their every-day work in order
to build a more open and reproducible science and promote the interaction and
collaboration between scientists form all around the world.

I'm also really into:
  * Python
  * Git (simply lifesaver)
  * LaTeX (best texts you'll ever produce)
  * Outdoors sports (hiking, rock climbing, biking, kayaking, etc)
