I'm a Lic. in Physics, got my degree at the Universidad Nacional de Rosario,
Argentina. Now I'm doing my Phd in Geophysics at the [Universidad Nacional
de San Juan][unsj] in the [Instituto Geofísico Sismológico Volponi][igsv],
with the support of scholarship provided by [CONICET].

I'm a longtime GNU/Linux user, mainly of the [Debian] distribution, and
a Software Libre supporter.
If you haven't ever heard of Software Libre or don't precisely know what
it is, I encourage you to read the 
[Wikipedia entry about Free Software][wiki-free-soft] and 
further the [Free Software Foundation documentation][fsf-docs].

I am contributing with the [Fatiando a Terra](http://www.fatiando.org), 
Python library for geophysical modeling and inversion, released under Software 
Libre license. I encourage every scientist to leave proprietary software 
behind and start using Free Software on their every-day work in order to build 
a more open and reproducible science and promote the interaction and 
collaboration between scientists form all around the world.

I'm also really into:
  * Python programming language
  * Git (simply lifesaver)
  * LaTeX (best texts you'll ever produce)
  * Outside sports (hiking, rock climbing, biking, kayaking, etc)
