# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!

gem "jekyll", "~> 3.5"

# If you want to run this web as a ruby-gem, uncomment the
# 'gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll' line  and comment the
# 'gem "github-pages" ...' one.
# If otherwise you want to publish it in Github Pages, do otherwise.
# Also some changes in _config.yml are needed

# gem "minimal-mistakes-jekyll"
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins

# To upgrade, run `bundle update`.

# The following plugins are automatically loaded by the theme-gem:
#   gem "jekyll-paginate"
#   gem "jekyll-sitemap"
#   gem "jekyll-gist"
#   gem "jekyll-feed"
#   gem "jemoji"
#   gem "jekyll-data"
#
# If you have any other plugins, put them here!
